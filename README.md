# Netflix Resume

This extension allows you to automatically resume playback of your latest show
by going to: https://www.netflix.com/resume

This will also redirect Netflix's home page to the title card of your latest
show. Not only will this load faster than the default page, but it also
guarantees that your "continue watching" selection is on top.

Note: After adding this extension, you must start watching at least one show
before these changes can take effect.
